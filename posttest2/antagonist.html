                <dt>Lord Muzan Kibutsuji</dt>
                <dd>A millennium ago, Muzan was turned into a Demon while trying to cure his own terminal illness, and his goal since then was to live without the fear of death and gain true immortality. He attempts to accomplish this by getting rid of his weakness of the sunlight which he is currently doing in 2 ways: finding the Blue Spider Lily or creating more Demons in hopes that one day one would be able to conquer their weakness of the sunlight.</dd>
